The CAPM model explains the relationship between systematic risk and the expected return for assets (e.g., stocks). The CAPM is used for pricing of risky assets, by generating the expected return of the asset given its riskiness, and calculating the cost of capital. Intuitively, the CAPM model tells us that the return of a risky asset is explained by the market factor (i.e., $r_m$)\n","\n","$$\\bar{r}_a = r_f + \\beta_a (\\bar{r}_m - r_f)$$\n","\n","\n","$\\bar{r}_a$: The return of the asset. This is can be the return of the any stock (i.e., Apple, Google, Tesla) or investment portfolio (i.e., any mutual/hedge fund portfolio).\n","\n","$r_f$: The return of the risk-free asset. The risk-free asset is usually given by the US 3-month Treasury bill. It is assumed that the US government will not default on a short-term government security, thus the US 3-month Treasury bill is widely assumed in finance to be risk-free. $\\bar{r}_m$\n","\n","$\\bar{r}_m$​​ : The return of the market. This is usually given by the S&P500 return as it is the largest market index in the world.\n","\n","\\\\\n","The CAPM can also be expressed mathematically in the following notation:\n","$$r-r_f = \\alpha + \\beta_M (MKT-r_f)$$\n","\n","\n","We will use the above notation going forward.\n","\n","Note: If you are running an asset pricing model on stocks in countries outside the US, it may be more applicable to change $r_m$ ($r_f$) to the market index (short-term government security) of that country.\n","\n","### Fama-French 3-factor (FF3)\n","Another very popular asset pricing model in the empirical finance literature is the Fama-French 3-factor (FF3) that was published in 1993. Nobel Laureate Eugene Fama and researcher Kenneth French found that value stocks tend to outperform growth stocks (i.e., value), and that small-cap stocks outperform large-cap stocks (i.e., size). Thus, the FF3 mode adds in size and value as risk factors to the model as shown below\n","\n","$$r-r_f = \\alpha + \\beta_M (MKT-r_f) + \\beta_S SMB + \\beta_v HML$$\n","\n","### Fama-French 5-factor (FF5)\n","In 2015, Fama-French added two more risk factors into their popular 3-factor asset pricing model to make a Fama-French 5-factor (FF5) model. This model added two 'quality' factors, namely profitability (stocks with a high operating profitability perform better) and investment (stocks of companies with high total asset growth have below average returns) factors.\n","\n","$$r-r_f = \\alpha + \\beta_M (MKT-r_f) + \\beta_S SMB + \\beta_v HML + \\beta_r RMW + \\beta_c CMA$$\n","\n","SMB: The return spread of small minus large stocks (size).\n","\n","HML: The return of cheap minus expensive stocks (value).\n","\n","RMW: The return spread of the most profitable firms minus the least profitable (profit).\n","\n","CMA: The return spread of firms that invest conservatively minus aggressively (investment).\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"U0RmVpTK-9eW"},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"o2oZ2U387gQS"},"source":["## Solution"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zAQA0Zt57IFV"},"source":["### Importing the Python modules\n","When you use the import *module* as *short_form*, this allows you to apply functions with the short_form instead.

If you are familiar with finance, you might know what the acronym \"TANSTAAFL\" stands for. It is a famous acronym for \"There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch\". This concept is also closely related to 'risk-return trade-off'.\n","\n","Higher risk is associated with greater probability of higher return and lower risk with a greater probability of smaller return. MPT assumes that investors are risk-averse, meaning that given two portfolios that offer the same expected return, investors will prefer the less risky one. Thus, an investor will take on increased risk only if compensated by higher expected returns."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SmV_47aDnSMR"},"source":["Another factor comes in to play in MPT is \"diversification\". Modern portfolio theory says that it is not enough to look at the expected risk and return of one particular stock. By investing in more than one stock, an investor can reap the benefits of diversification – chief among them, a reduction in the riskiness of the portfolio.\n","\n","What you need to understand is \"risk of a portfolio is not equal to average/weighted-average of individual stocks in the portfolio\". In terms of return, yes it is the average/weighted average of individual stock's returns, but that's not the case for risk. The risk is about how volatile the asset is, if you have more than one stock in your portfolio, then you have to take count of how these stocks movement correlates with each other. The beauty of diversification is that you can even get lower risk than a stock with the lowest risk in your portfolio, by optimising the allocation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xP5O98lWnSMT"},"source":["I will try to explain as I go along with the actual code.
